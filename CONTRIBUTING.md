- **Ensure the bug isn't already reporetd** by searching in the [issues](https://github.com/orchid-lang/frontend/issues)
- **If you can't find an open issue for your problem**, [open a new one](https://github.com/orchid-lang/frontend/issues/new) with the `bug` label.

This section guides you through submitting a feature request for Orchid compiler frontend, including some requirements and best practices.

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Provide a step-by-step description** of the suggested feature in as much detail as possible.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users of the compiler, not just the frontend.

## Style guides

Keep in mind these are just guidelines. It's not the end of the world if these are not used, but at least try to use them.

### Commit Mesages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to..").
- Keep messages short and simple.
- Refrence issues and pull requests as much as you can.

### Coding style

- Follow the conventions that are used in the project already.
- Ensure any new code passes all tests if the modified code had tests.
- If you write new functionality, try to write tests for it.

### Additional notes

- **enhancement**: New feature or request.
- **documentation**: Improvements or addition to documentation.
- **question**: For if you have any questions, or dont understand something.
